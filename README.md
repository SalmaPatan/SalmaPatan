# 👋 Hi there, I'm Salma

## 🚀 Full Stack Developer | Passionate Problem Solver | Sports Enthusiast

I’m a driven and detail-oriented Full Stack Web Developer with a strong foundation in crafting responsive, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. My journey into tech began from a non-technical background, and through relentless energy, curiosity, and enthusiasm, I’ve carved a path into the world of code—transforming passion into profession.

At Lystloc, I’ve been part of impactful projects that involve building reusable component libraries, optimizing large-scale SPAs, and seamlessly integrating APIs and third-party tools. I'm well-versed in tools and frameworks like ReactJS, Redux, React Router, MUI, and proficient with modern frontend tooling including Webpack, Babel, and Vite. I also bring foundational knowledge in Docker and AWS, giving me an edge in full-stack and deployment workflows.

Beyond the screen, I’m a sports lover who enjoys the thrill of teamwork and competition—especially when I’m on the hockey field. Whether it’s writing clean code or scoring a goal, I bring the same passion and focus to everything I do.

💼 Currently at **Lystloc**, I've worked on:
- 🔁 Building **reusable component libraries**
- ⚡ Optimizing **large-scale Single Page Applications**
- 🔌 Integrating **RESTful APIs** & third-party libraries
- 🧠 Managing state with **Redux** & **Context API**
- 🛠 Leveraging modern tools like **Webpack**, **Vite**, and **Babel**
- ☁️ Gaining hands-on experience with **Docker** and **AWS**

Outside of development, I'm a **sports lover** with a deep passion for **hockey**, and I bring the same energy to the field as I do to the codebase.
